We've set up [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/GQCG-edu/master-thesis-article/discussions) in order to provide a platform for sharing ideas and asking questions. So, if you have an idea for a new feature, or if you have a proposal for a refactor, please open a new discussion topic in one of the appropriate categories. No code is perfect, but with your suggestions we can continuously improve this template!

If you are a developer and would like to contribute, please submit a pull request from your `feature/your_feature` branch to `main` and ask for a review!
